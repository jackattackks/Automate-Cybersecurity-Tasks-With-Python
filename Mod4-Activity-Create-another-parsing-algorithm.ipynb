In the code below, the method is applied to the string `\" \"`, which contains just a space character. The argument of the `.join()` method is the iterable you want to convert, and in this case, that's `ip_addresses`. As a result, it converts `ip_addresses` from a list back into a string with a space between each element and the next.\n",

    "- Python has functions and syntax that help you import and parse text files.
  - The `with` statement allows you to efficiently handle files.
  - The `open()` function allows you to import or open a file. It takes in the name of the file as the first parameter and a string that indicates the purpose of opening the file as the second parameter.
    - Specify `"r"` as the second parameter if you're opening the file for reading purposes.
    - Specify `"w"` as the second parameter if you're opening the file for writing purposes.
  - The `.read()` method allows you to read in a file. 
  - The `.write()` method allows you to append or write to a file.
- You can use a `for` loop to iterate over a list.
- You can use an `if` statement to check if a given value is in a list and execute a specific action if so.
- You can use the `.split()` method to convert a string to a list.
- You can use Python to compare contents of a text file against elements of a list.
- Algorithms can be incorporated into functions. When defining a function, you must specify the parameters it takes in and the actions it should execute."
